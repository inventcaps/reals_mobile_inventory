# 🚀 Free Deployment Guide - Railway

Complete step-by-step guide para i-deploy ang Real's Mobile Inventory with **offline mode working**!

---

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Files (Already Created!)

Naka-ready na lahat ng files:

- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Updated with gunicorn & whitenoise
- ✅ `Procfile` - Railway/Heroku deployment config
- ✅ `runtime.txt` - Python version
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway-specific config
- ✅ `settings.py` - WhiteNoise middleware added
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Prevents committing sensitive files

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Note:** Make sure `.env` is NOT pushed (already in .gitignore)

---

## 🚂 Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### A. Sign Up / Login to Railway

1. Go to: **https://railway.app**
2. Click **"Login with GitHub"**
3. Authorize Railway to access your repos

### B. Create New Project

1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose your repository: `reals_mobile_inventory`
4. Railway will auto-detect Django and start deploying!

### C. Configure Environment Variables

Click on your project → **Variables** tab → Add these:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-generate-new-one
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=*.railway.app

# Database (Use your Supabase)
DB_NAME=postgres
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=Reals_db_123
DB_HOST=db.rczsumkmhoxjaycvggzt.supabase.co
DB_PORT=5432
```

**Generate SECRET_KEY:**
```python
# Run this in Python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))
```

### D. Deploy!

1. Railway automatically builds and deploys
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app.railway.app`

   Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   Start Command: gunicorn mobile_inventory.wsgi:application
   ```
6. Add environment variables (same as Railway)
7. Deploy!

**Render Free Tier:**
- ✅ Completely free forever

---

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Create Superuser (Admin Account)

Railway Console:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Or connect via Railway CLI:
```bash
railway login
railway link
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 2. Test Admin Panel

Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/admin`

### 3. Update ALLOWED_HOSTS

If you get "DisallowedHost" error:

Add your domain to Railway environment variables:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app.railway.app,*.railway.app
```

---

## 📱 Install as PWA

### Android (Chrome):
1. Open deployed URL
2. Menu → **"Add to Home screen"**
3. App installs!

### iPhone (Safari):
1. Open deployed URL
2. Share → **"Add to Home Screen"**
3. Done!

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Looks like native app
- ✅ Fullscreen mode
- ✅ Offline mode works perfectly
- ✅ Fast loading

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Application Error"

**Check Railway Logs:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click **"View Logs"**
3. Look for errors

**Common fixes:**
- Verify environment variables
- Check database connection
- Ensure `collectstatic` ran successfully

### Problem: Static files not loading

**Solution:**
```bash
# In Railway console
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

Or add to `railway.json` start command (already done!)

### Problem: Database connection failed

**Check:**
- ✅ Supabase database is running
- ✅ DB credentials correct in environment variables
- ✅ Supabase allows external connections

### Problem: Offline mode not working

**Verify:**
1. Service Worker registered (check browser console)
2. HTTPS enabled (required for Service Workers)
3. Pages visited while online first
4. Browser supports Service Workers

   ```
3. Railway auto-deploys!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Keep Local & Production Separate

**Local (.env):**
```
DEBUG=True
DB_HOST=localhost
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.1.197
```

**Production (Railway Variables):**
```
DEBUG=False
DB_HOST=db.rczsumkmhoxjaycvggzt.supabase.co
ALLOWED_HOSTS=*.railway.app
```

### 2. Test Locally Before Deploying

```bash
# Simulate production
DEBUG=False python manage.py runserver
```

### 3. Database Backups

Supabase has automatic backups, but also:
```bash
# Export data
python manage.py dumpdata > backup.json

# Import data
python manage.py loaddata backup.json
```
